# SalesForce Query

This project helps automate the process of fetching Salesforce cases. It is designed to retrieve team and personal cases based on predefined queries and display relevant information based on the configuration in the `config.json` file.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3**: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
	- You can check this by running: 
		```python3 --version```
	- If you donâ€™t have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Dependencies**: You need the `requests` and `rich` library to interact with the Salesforce API.
	- Install the necessary dependencies by running:
		```pip3 install requests```
    	```pip3 install rich```

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, download or clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gdd12/SalesForceQuery.git
```

### 2. First-Time Setup

Navigate to the root directory and run the script.
```bash
cd SalesForceQuery/src
python3 main.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter the configuration - follow the wizard.

### Configurable after setup:
If you see a product missing from this tool you can add it to the 'products' list in the config.json located in config/ with the the value of 'True'.

Changing the configuration can be performed manually or through the wizard seen when executing the script with the -setup flag.

```bash
Available tool flags:
-notify							   > Forces notifications to be sent
-config							   > Prints the current config to the screen
-exclude [Case Number OR 'Reset']  > Adds a case number to the excludedCases.cfg so you are not notified. 'RESET' will clear this file.
-setup							   > Triggers an interactive setup to rewrite the current configuration
-test ['info' OR 'debug']		   > Enabled INFO or DEBUG logging for testing/troubleshooting purposes
-team ['print' OR ('update' <Team Name> <'Viewable' OR None>)]
```
